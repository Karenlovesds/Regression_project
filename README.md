Techlent Regression Project: Providing data-driven suggestions for customers


We are an agency helping our customers purchase XoX (a made-up product) from various makers. Price is one of the most important things we care about. We need to estimate the price of a XoX before we recommend it to our customers. However, the estimations vary significantly with our employees' experience.

We would like you to build a machine learning model to accurately predict the price for a future purchase and provide insights to help us explain the predicted price to our customers. Please note that neither our customers nor us have any knowledge about machine learning. A sample of our sales record is available in ../data/sales.csv.

Preprocess, clean, analyze and visualized the provided data. A few sentences or plots describing your approach will suffice. Any thing you would like us to know about the price?
Build a machine learning model to help us determine the price for a purchase. Discuss why you choose the approaches, what alternatives you consider, and any concerns you have. How is the performance of your model?
Help us understand how the price is predicted (again, a few sentences will suffice).
